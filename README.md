# Simple multilingual site

[Cette page en français.](LISEZMOI.md)

In this code repository I offer you an example of a multilingual site that's easy to adapt and customize if you have a basic understanding of PHP web development.

I've integrated what's needed to ensure proper support by search engines for your SEO purposes. Of course, it's up to you to add everything else (schema, content, page generation, translations, one or more languages as required).

In this example, the HTML pages are simple, based on a single web page template. Of course, you're free to use global templates as well as language-dependent templates (particularly for your site's menu, hard-coded in English in "./src/theme/default.php").

If you need further explanation, don't hesitate to contact me or have a look at the "[Web developer's tips](https://trucs-de-developpeur-web.fr/)" blog, where I'll be posting some basic explanations. If you'd like to apply this to your site, but don't know how, I can make you a proposal as a freelance developer. Just [contact me](https://vasur.fr/about).

## Compatibility

When I code, I work locally with XAMPP on Windows. My projects work for this stack.

There's no guarantee of compatibility with other software or versions, even though I try to keep my code clean and avoid using too many specific things.
